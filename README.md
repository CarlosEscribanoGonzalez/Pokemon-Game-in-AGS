# Pokémon Unofficial Fan-Made Game

This is an unofficial **Pokémon** game developed in **Adventure Game Studio** during my first year of university for the course on **Narrative, Scriptwriting, and Storyboarding**. 

### About the Project

The objective of this project was to create a script based on an existing fictional universe and develop the corresponding game. This experience helped me enhance my skills in narrative design and game development, allowing me to explore storytelling within the Pokémon universe.

### Features
- Engaging storyline set in the Pokémon universe.
- Developed using Adventure Game Studio.
- Focused on narrative and scriptwriting techniques.

### Technologies
- **Adventure Game Studio**
